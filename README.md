This is the main repository for the Macaw binary analysis framework.
This framework is implemented to offer extensible support for
architectures.

The main algorithm implemented so far is a code discovery procedure
which will discover reachable code in the binary given one or more
entry points such as `_start` or the current symbols.

The core libraries are:

* macaw-base -- The core architecture-independent operations and algorithms.
* macaw-symbolic -- Library that provides symbolic simulation of Macaw programs via Crucible.
* macaw-x86 -- Provides definitions enabling Macaw to be used on X86_64 programs.
* macaw-x86-symbolic -- Adds Macaw-symbolic extensions needed to support x86.

The libraries that make up Macaw are released under the BSD license.

To build with Stack, first create a top-level `stack.yaml` file by
symlinking to one of the provided `stack-ghc-<version>.yaml`
files. E.g.

    ln -s stack-ghc-8.2.yaml stack.yaml
    stack build
