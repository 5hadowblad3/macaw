This directory contains small unit tests used to develop an
understanding of specific x86 instructions.

The tests can be executed via `make run`.  If any fail, this suggests
that our understanding of the instruction semantics was incorrect.

It is not strictly needed for macaw-x86, but included when we need to
revisit instruction semantics.
